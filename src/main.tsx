			// If the data is stale(old), react-query will attempt to fetch new data from the backend, while at the same time
			// returning the stale data from the cache to the application. Whith this approach we can show the user the cache data inmediatly, while
			// also getting the latest data in the background. Once we have the updated data, react query updates the cache and notifies our components that new data is available.
			// Our component will then rerender with fresh data.
